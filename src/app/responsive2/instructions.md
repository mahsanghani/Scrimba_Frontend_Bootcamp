### Instructions
#### All green text
- color: #99d930
- Font-weight: 900

####The headings
- h1: 80px
- h2: 60px

#### Button hover/focus
- background: #fff
- color: #252525

### Your challenge
- Change all the font sizes to rem
- Change any margin/padding to em or rem
- You can round up/down slightly if you’d like

### Your challenge
- Change the base font-size for everything to .9rem
- Create a media query that targets a viewport of 600px and bigger
- Inside the media query, set the base font-size to 1.3125rem
- Declare something to prevent the images from overflowing at small screen sizes

### Tips
- We have to select the html element to change the “base” font-size
- For the images, we want to set a maximum width, which means if their parent is smaller than the image, the image will shrink with it

### Your challenge
- Prevent the text from touching the left and right of the viewport at small screens

### Your challenge
- Create a new media query that targets viewports that are 750px and larger
- At that screen size, we want the ‘.about-me’ and ‘.articles’ to go next to one another

### Tips
- You will have to add to the HTML to make this work

### Your challenge
- Everything in this challenge is only for 750px and bigger
- You cannot touch the HTML
- Change the background color of ‘.article’ to green
- Change all the text to be #252525

### Your challenge
Everything in this challenge is only for 750px and bigger
You cannot touch the HTML
In the ‘.articles’ section, change the border colors on the h2 to black
Change the button’s background color to #252525 and text to #fff
Change the button’s hover background to white, and text to #252525

### Tips
- Because you can’t touch the HTML, you’ll have to pay attention to your selectors
- Double check everything to make sure you didn’t have any unintended consequences in other parts

### Your challenge
Change the `header`’s height minimum height to `100vh`
Center all the content in it vertically
Center all the content in the two `section`s vertically (you will only see a change in one of them, that’s fine for now)

### Your challenge
- You will have to change the HTML to get this layout to work
- We want the first two sections to stay next to each other at large screens
- The new section must be full-width underneath the other two at large screens
- The new section must stay inside the <main> element

### Your challenge
- At small screens, this section should have a white background
- Above 750px, it should have a background of #252525 and white text
- Above 750px, the .container in this section should max out at 1200px
- Above 750px, the three images should go next to one another, with a width of 28%, and spaced out equally

### Your challenge
- At large screens (about 750px), this section should have a minimum height of 100vh and the content centered vertically
- The images should have a width of 100%, and a height of 15em.
- Fix the images so that they don’t stretch when given their height.
