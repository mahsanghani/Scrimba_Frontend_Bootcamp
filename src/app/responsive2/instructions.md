- color: #99d930
- Font-weight: 900

####The headings
- h1: 80px
- h2: 60px

#### Button hover/focus

### Your challenge
- Change all the font sizes to rem
- Change any margin/padding to em or rem
- You can round up/down slightly if you’d like

### Your challenge
- Change the base font-size for everything to .9rem
- Create a media query that targets a viewport of 600px and bigger
- Inside the media query, set the base font-size to 1.3125rem
- Declare something to prevent the images from overflowing at small screen sizes

### Tips
- We have to select the html element to change the “base” font-size
- For the images, we want to set a maximum width, which means if their parent is smaller than the image, the image will shrink with it
