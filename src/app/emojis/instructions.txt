/* 1. Loop through the myEmojis array and log each of them out to the console
2. Grab the emojiContainer div and store it in a variable. Log it to the console
console.log(myEmojis[i]) */

/* Render the emojis as <span> tags in the emojisContainer <div>
Hints: Use either createElement(), textContent, and append()
or innerHTML and a template string
write your code here */

/* Hook an event listener up with the button, and log out the input field's value when it's clicked
Push the emoji into the myEmoji's array, and clear the input field
However, if the input value is empty, don't do anything */

/* Render the updated myEmojis array in the mini-browser.
One solution: wrap the code for rendering the emojis in a function and make sure it
clears away old version of the array before it renders the updated one */

// Make the unshift button work just as the push button (but with unshifting instead of pushing)

// Make the pop and shift buttons work as well
